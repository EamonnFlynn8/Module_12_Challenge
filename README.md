**Credit Analysis Report**

* The purpose of this analysis was to create a regression model in order to predict those who we are making risky loans too in order to minimize this companys risk.

* Precision scores of Original Data: Class 0: 1.00, Class 1: 0.85
* Recall scores of Original Data: Class 0: 0.99, Class 1: 0.91
* Precision scores of Resampled Data: Class 0: 1.00, Class 1: 0.84
* Recall scores of Resampled Data: Class 0: 0.99, Class 1: 0.99

* The results of this data means that the resampled data did a better job in prediciting because we want to have a better predicition score for our class 1, high risk loans and want to minimize the false-negative rate since those are what we ant to avoid prediciting. Thus the recall score is the most important statistic in all of this, as long as the prediction scores too, but since they are quite similar, the .08 differnece in the recall scores is even more significant.
